        <h2> Description </h2>

    <p>
        Nasi Lemak is a beloved Malaysian dish that translates to "rich rice," referring to the creamy, aromatic rice cooked in coconut milk and pandan leaves. This dish is often considered Malaysia's national dish and is enjoyed at any time of the day, whether as breakfast, lunch, or dinner.
        Traditionally served with a variety of accompaniments, Nasi Lemak includes sambal (a spicy chili paste), crispy fried anchovies (ikan bilis), 
        roasted peanuts, hard-boiled eggs, and fresh cucumber slices. For a more filling meal, it can be paired with side dishes like fried chicken, curry, or rendang. Its combination of sweet, spicy, and savory flavors makes it a true delight for the taste buds.

    <h1>Steps on how to make it</h1>

    <ol> 
        <h2>Step 1: Cook the Coconut Rice</h2>
        <li>Rinse the rice thoroughly to remove excess starch.</li>
        <li>In a rice cooker or pot, combine the rinsed rice, coconut milk, pandan leaves, water, and salt.</li>

        <h2>Step 2: Prepare the Sambal</h2>
        <li>Heat oil in a pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Saut√© the sliced onions, blended chilies, and minced garlic until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the tamarind water, sugar, and salt, then stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Simmer the mixture on low heat for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sambal thickens. Adjust sweetness and spiciness to taste.</li>
        
        <h2>3: Fry the Anchovies</h2> 
        <li>Heat oil in a small pan.</li>
        <li>Fry the ikan bilis (anchovies) until crispy. Remove and set aside.</li>

        <h2>Step 4: Prepare the Sides</h2>
        <li>Roast the peanuts in a dry pan or bake them until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Slice the cucumber into thin rounds.</li>
        <li>Boil the eggs, peel, and cut them in half.</li>
        <li>Optionally, prepare fried chicken, curry, or rendang as additional sides.</li>
